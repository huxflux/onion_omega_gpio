GPIO C-functions for Onion Omega 

Copyright (C) 2016 Sildradassen Software

GPIO functions written in C. Remember to open the GPIO first, then set the
direction to whatever you need. The functions should be pretty straightforward
to understand.

You'll need the Expansion Dock and storage outside of the 16MB. Gcc needs about
22MB.

The main.c program is just for testing purposes. Chaotic LEDs.

No `make` on the Onion Omega as of yet. Compile with
`gcc main.c gpio.c -o chaos`. Execute with `./chaos`
